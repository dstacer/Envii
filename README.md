# Envii
(En)tity (Vi)sual(i)zer - An engine for interactive graphical applications like games and data visualizers.  Envii will initially use OpenGL and run on Windows.  Depending on interest level, support for other platforms and rendering APIs may be added in the future.

Development focus will start with high-performance 2D batch rendering, integrating more 3D features at a later stage.
